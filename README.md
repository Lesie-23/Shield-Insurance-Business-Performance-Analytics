# Shield Insurance — Business Performance Analytics Dashboard

## 🏢 Company Overview

Shield Insurance is a customer-focused general insurance provider operating across multiple urban markets in India. The company operates across key metros including Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Indore. Policies are distributed through multiple channels such as offline agents, direct sales, mobile apps and web platforms, serving customers across different age groups and financial needs.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Management at Shield Insurance required a unified analytics solution to better understand overall business health and revenue performance. Existing reports did not provide a consolidated view of:

●  Revenue performance trends

●  Customer growth patterns

●  Sales channel efficiency

●  City-level performance contribution

●  Age-group behavior and preferences

●  Policy-wise business value

This lack of visibility made it difficult for management to make data-driven strategic decisions and identify growth opportunities across markets, policies and customer segments.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides leadership with clear visibility into revenue performance, customer growth, sales channel efficiency, and policy contribution, enabling data-driven decisions and improved business performance.

## ⭐ Key Insights

● The business generated ₹989.25M in total revenue from 26.84K customers, with an average revenue of ₹36.86K per customer.

● March 2023 recorded the strongest business performance, contributing 82.3% of total customers and 85.0% of total revenue. This was followed by a slowdown in April, where customers declined by 41.4% and revenue fell by 41.7%, indicating volatility in business momentum.

● Delhi NCR and Mumbai contribute the largest share of both customers and revenue, making them key performance-driving regions, but also creating dependency on a small number of major markets.

● Offline-Agent sales remain the dominant channel, contributing more than 55% of total revenue, while the Online-Website channel contributes only ~12.6%. This reflects strong trust in agent-assisted purchasing, but also limited digital scale.

● Around 61–67% of total revenue comes from the Top 3 policies, with POL2005HEL being the strongest performer across channels and age groups, while POL4321HEL remains the lowest revenue-generating policy, increasing product concentration risk.

● Customers aged 31–50 form the largest share of the customer base, while customers aged 51–64 and 65+ contribute a higher share of revenue due to selection of higher-premium policy plans.

## ✔ Recommendations

● Maintain strong performance in Delhi NCR and Mumbai, while gradually lifting growth in secondary cities to reduce over-reliance on a few key regions.

● Continue strengthening the Offline-Agent network while steadily improving the online purchase journey and channel conversion, so digital contribution increases without losing advisory support.

● Position POL2005HEL as a flagship policy, while redesigning or repositioning low-adoption policies such as POL4321HEL, so revenue is distributed across a broader product mix.

● Improve awareness and positioning of other products so revenue dependency on the Top 3 policies reduces over time.

● Target customers aged 31–50 for scalable acquisition, while designing premium-value offerings for customers aged 51–64 and 65+ who typically purchase higher-coverage plans.

## 🧠 What I Learned

●  How to translate business requirements into measurable KPIs

●  Why a strong data model is critical before dashboard design

●  How to communicate insights in a way leadership can act on

This project helped me move beyond just building dashboards and start thinking like an analyst, focusing on defining the right KPIs, structuring the data correctly, and designing visuals that support real decision-making.
