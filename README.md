# Shield Insurance — Business Performance Analytics Dashboard

## 🏢 Company Overview

Shield Insurance is a general insurance provider focused on delivering customer-centric financial protection. The company operates across key metros including Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Indore. Policies are distributed through multiple channels such as offline agents, direct sales, mobile apps and web platforms, serving customers across different age groups and financial needs.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Leadership at Shield Insurance required a unified analytics solution to better understand overall business health and revenue performance. Existing reports did not provide a consolidated view of:

●  Revenue performance trends

●  Customer growth patterns

●  Sales channel efficiency

●  City-level performance contribution

●  Age-group behavior and preferences

●  Policy-wise business value

This lack of visibility made it difficult for management to make data-driven strategic decisions and identify growth opportunities across markets, policies and customer segments.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides leadership with clear visibility into revenue performance, customer growth, sales channel efficiency, and policy contribution, enabling data-driven decisions and improved business performance.

## ⭐ Key Insights

●  The business generated ₹989.25M in total revenue from 26.84K customers, with an average revenue of ₹36.86K per customer, supported by steady daily growth indicators.

●  March 2023 recorded the strongest business performance, contributing 82.3% of total customers and 85% of total revenue, followed by a slowdown in April where customers declined by 41.4% and revenue fell by 41.7%.

● Delhi NCR and Mumbai contribute the highest share of both customers and revenue, making them the strongest performing business regions.

●  Offline-Agent remains the leading sales channel, contributing more than 55% of total revenue, while the Online-Website channel contributes only ~12.6%, reflecting higher trust in agent-assisted policy purchasing.

●  Around 61–67% of total revenue comes from the Top 3 policies, with POL2005HEL being the strongest performer across channels and age groups, while POL4321HEL shows the lowest adoption and revenue contribution.

●  Customers aged 31–50 form the largest share of the customer base, while customers aged 51–64 and 65+ contribute a higher share of revenue due to higher-premium policy selections.

## ✔ Recommendations

●  Focus business expansion and marketing budget on Delhi NCR and Mumbai, where revenue impact is highest.

●  Continue strengthening Offline-Agent capability, as it remains the most trusted and productive channel.

●  Grow digital adoption gradually through guided onboarding and hybrid agent-support, rather than replacing human interaction.

●  Position POL2005HEL as a flagship policy, while reviewing low-adoption policies such as POL4321HEL for optimization or repositioning.

●  Target customers aged 31–50 for scalable growth, while designing premium-value offerings for 51–64 and 65+ customers who purchase higher-value policies.

●  Reduce business dependency on the Top 3 policies by improving adoption of other insurance products.
